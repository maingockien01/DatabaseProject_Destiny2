# DatabaseProject_Destiny2
A database project intended to fulfill course requirements for COMP 3380 for the University of Manitoba. Utilizes the Bungie API and Destiny 2 database information.

This project will:
  Create a database with DB2 that contains most records of "Weapons" from Destiny 2. It will allow users a front-end access point from which they can make a list of arbitrarily created queries, and they will be able to request the contents of any table within the database.
  
I do not own any of the data taken from the Bungie API, nor do any of the contributors to this project own any of the data taken from the Bungie API.


<Edit this as required, also an update to licence might be needed? This is all very stressful>
