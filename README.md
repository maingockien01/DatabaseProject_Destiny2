# DatabaseProject_Destiny2
A database project intended to fulfill course requirements for COMP 3380 for the University of Manitoba. Utilizes the Bungie API and Destiny 2 database information.

This project will:
  Create a database with DB2 that contains most records of "Weapons" from Destiny 2. It will allow users a front-end access point from which they can make a list of arbitrarily created queries, and they will be able to request the contents of any table within the database.
  
I do not own any of the data taken from the Bungie API, nor do any of the contributors to this project own any of the data taken from the Bungie API.


For my fellow contributors, here are a bunch of links that may help you, once we get around to coding!

Very Basic "Getting Started" Read this first.
http://destinydevs.github.io/BungieNetPlatform/docs/Getting-Started
(The rest of these are not presented in a read-this-next order.)

Github Link, Official Bungie Stuff.
https://github.com/Bungie-net/api/wiki

More official Bungie stufff but on a fuck-you-large single page.
https://bungie-net.github.io/index.html

An unofficial page created and maintained by community members, may be more feasible to start reading.
https://github.com/vpzed/Destiny2-API-Info/wiki

A database that does a lot of what we're trying to do, that is community created for the purpose of helping developers (That's us now!) Understand what's going on. Worth a look.
